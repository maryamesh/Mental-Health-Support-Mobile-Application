# Mental-Health-Support-Mobile-Application
## Overview
Mental-Health-Support-Mobile-Application is an innovative mobile app designed to provide mental health support through an AI-powered chatbot that acts as a virtual therapist. It also includes web scraping features for social media analysis to detect signs of mental health distress and an emergency system for users at risk of suicide.

The application leverages advanced technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Neural Networks, and Flutter to deliver a comprehensive mental health support tool.
### Phase 1: Mood Tracking
This repository contains the code for the Mood Tracking component, the first phase of the development process. This component uses a fine-tuned transformer model to classify emotions in text data, allowing the AI-powered chatbot to assess the userâ€™s emotional state.
#### Model and Datasets
- Pretrained Model: The mood tracking model is based on the [roberta-base-go_emotions](https://huggingface.co/SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions) transformer model, pretrained on the GoEmotions dataset from Hugging Face.
- Fine-Tuning:
  - The model was first fine-tuned using the [SetFit/emotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SetFit/emotion) dataset from Hugging Face.
  - A second fine-tuning was performed using the [Emotion Detection from Text dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pashupatigupta/emotion-detection-from-text) from Kaggle.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the code, you need the following:
- Python 3.8 or later
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Hugging Face Datasets
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
Install the required Python libraries using:
```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets scikit-learn pandas
```
Usage
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maryamesh/Mental-Health-Support-Mobile-Application.git
cd Mental-Health-Support-Mobile-Application
```
2. Run the Mood Tracking Script
The script `mood_tracking.py` processes the input text data and evaluates the user's mood:
```bash
python mood_tracking.py
```
Ensure that you have the dataset `tweet_emotions.csv` in the correct path, or adjust the file path in the script accordingly.
Code Explanation
- **Loading Pretrained Model**: The script begins by loading a pretrained transformer model from Hugging Face (`roberta-base-go_emotions`) and fine-tunes it on custom datasets to adapt it to the mood tracking use case.
- **Preprocessing**: Text data is preprocessed to remove unnecessary columns (`tweet_id`, `sentiment`) and is tokenized using the Hugging Face tokenizer for input to the model.
- **Model Evaluation**: The fine-tuned model predicts the user's emotional state based on their text input. The script outputs the predicted probabilities for each emotion label.
Future Development
- **Phase 2**: Integrate the mood tracking model with the AI-powered chatbot for real-time emotion detection and response generation.
- **Phase 3**: Implement web scraping features for social media analysis to identify signs of mental health distress.
- **Phase 4**: Develop an emergency response system for users at risk of suicide, including features for alerting emergency contacts or hotlines.
Technologies Used
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For understanding and classifying user emotions.
- **Neural Networks**: To power the AI-driven chatbot and emotion detection models.
- **Flutter**: For building the mobile application across multiple platforms.
